# Lindbergh Game Installer Script

This Python script automates the installation of games for Lindbergh systems on [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) by mounting `.bin` images, extracting their content, and placing them in the correct directories. It also supports additional post-processing, such as moving specific files or folders and creating `.game` launcher files for each installed game.

## Features
- Mount `.bin` files using Linux file systems (`ext2`, `ext3`).
- Extract specified directories (e.g., `disk0`, `disk1`) and copy their content to the target folder.
- Handle multiple `.bin` files per game, supporting additional data files.
- Automate folder organization and file structure adjustments based on YAML configuration.
- Create `.game` launcher files in the appropriate directories.
- Log progress and provide clear feedback for each step of the process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- YAML configuration file (`games_config.yml`) defining the games and their associated files.

## Looking for the right files?
If you're looking for the correct files for installation, performing a quick search with the keyword **lindberghromsbinbatocera** or **SEGA_Lindbergh_YELLOW-RomVault** on Archives  may help you locate the appropriate `.bin` files needed for this script.


## Configuration Example (YAML)
Hereâ€™s an example of how games are defined in the `games_config.yml` file:

```yaml
vf5fs:
  display_name: "Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown"
  launcher_path: ""
  filesystem: "ext2"
  steps:
    - file: "vf5fs.bin"
      copy_dirs:
        - "disk0"
        - "disk1"
    - file: "vf5fs_ext.bin"
      copy_dirs: "rom"
      destination: "rom"

hdkotr:
  display_name: "Harley Davidson King of the Road"
  filesystem: "ext2"
  steps:
    - file: "harley.bin"
      copy_dirs:
        - "disk0"
    - file: "harley_fs.bin"
      copy_dirs: []
      destination_subfolder: "fs"
    - file: "harley_fs2.bin"
      copy_dirs: []
      destination_subfolder: "fs"
```

## Usage
1. Place the `games_config.yml` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Ensure that the required `.bin` files are present in the working directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 lindbergh_installer.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a game to install, install all games, or exit.

## Notes
- The script reads the game configurations from the games_config.yml file. Each game's configuration includes the required .bin files, directories to copy, and additional processing steps.
- For games with multiple .bin files, the script processes each file according to the specified steps, including post-processing actions like file moves.
- If the target directory for a game already exists, the script skips the installation to avoid overwriting existing data.
- Launcher files (.game) are automatically created at the specified launcher_path in the configuration file or in the root directory if no launcher_path is provided.
- Both Hummer SLDX and Hummer Extreme Edition use the same hummer.bin file. This installer does not distinguish between the two versions automatically.
It is up to you to identify which version you have and select the correct option in the installer accordingly.
